# Guess The Number

This simple C# console game challenges you to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. But beware, you only have 10 attempts to crack the code!

## How to Play
### 1. Start the Game:
The computer will pick a random number between 1 and 100.
Get ready to make your guess!
### 2. Making Guesses:
Enter your guess when prompted.
Receive hints whether your guess is too high, too low, or spot on!
### 3. Win or Lose:
If you guess the number within 10 attempts, you win!
Run out of attempts, and you lose the game.
### 4. Restart or Exit:
After each game, decide whether to restart for another round or exit the game.
Press any key to restart or ESC to exit.

## How It Works
• The game uses a random number generator to select a mystery number.  
• Your input is validated to ensure it's a valid number between 1 and 100.  
• Receive hints about the proximity of your guess to the correct number.
